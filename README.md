# The Super Simple FPS Pack

This pack was made from the orginal First Person Shooter template for Unreal Engine 5.5 and has been updated to include:

* A fresh weapon (M4) with animations rigged and made with blender and a preset animation blueprint
* Completely updated game logic from movement to projectile functionality, including ADS functionality, random recoil, custom animation states (ex. Sprinting) and more
* An easy to learn HUD
* A cleaner blueprint system with detailed notes and collapsed nodes in each event graph to make learning easy
* A data table for creating new weapons with a customizable weapon structure system
* Animation notify based events and sound cues with custom sounds for making editing easy
* Set up on the default Unreal Engine Open World map instead of the standard FPS template level for making open world game creation easier

# Instructional

* Most instructions for using the package are included within their corresponding blueprint event graphs in the form of comments.

Getting Started:

* Start by opening your "Project Settings" in Unreal after you have added the package to your project of course
* In the project settings, navigate under "Project" and look for "Maps & Modes"
* Change your default GameMode to "FPS_GM"
* Change both the "Editor Startup Map" and "Game Default Map" to "UE_Basic_Open_World"
* You might want to go into the Demo folder as well and access the Manny skeleton then change the MagSocket location since it is a little off for the animation
* Here is an image for reference:
